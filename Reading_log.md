**Today's Progress**: Read the following books:

* Catherine the great portrait of a woman (175-184)
* Madame Bouvary (Part One - Second Half of Chapter VI (6))

**Thoughts:** I would say that `Madame Bouvary` profusely filled with innumerable classical words, that is quite tedious to understand. on the flip side Catherine the greate was quite amusing and fun to read, with little words to search for.
