**Today's Progress**: Read the following books:

* Catherine the great portrait of a woman (154-165)
* Madame Bouvary (Part One - Chapter V (5))

**Thoughts:** I stumbled across some difficult words, But I managed to get my head around them.
I decided to write down each and every word that I haven't cam across before.

###  Day 1: May 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read the following books:

* Catherine the great portrait of a woman (154-165)
* Madame Bouvary (Part One - Half of Chapter VI (6))

**Thoughts:** I was able to learn an write down some word from the first book, but at the same time
I couldn't manage to finish the chapter 6 of `Madame Bouvary`, because the vocabulary was so intense to keep up with.
