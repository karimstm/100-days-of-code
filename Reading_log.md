###  Day 0: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read the following books:

* Catherine the great portrait of a woman (154-165)
* Madame Bouvary (Part One - Chapter V (5))

**Thoughts:** I stumbled across some difficult words, But I managed to get my head around them.
I decided to write down each and every word that I haven't cam across before.
